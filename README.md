# Turing Yearbook

This is my first attempt at using the React framework. This application is built with two class components (an 'App' class and a controlled form) as well as two functional components.

The goal of this project was to create a yearbook-style application that displayed photos, names, quotes, and superlatives of Turing School staff as well as random student mock data. Users can update any name, quote, or superlative.

The controlled form compnent allows a user to create new students.
